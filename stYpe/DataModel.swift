    "Our goal at stYpe was to engineer a camera tracking solution that is simple to use, requires no recalibration and works with any camera, even handheld. As a result, we came up with RedSpy – a magnificent realization of our ideals.",
    "The traditional problem of optical tracking systems is limited camera cable bandwidth. With RedSpy, we looked ahead and developed special algorithms for FPGA to quickly compress the 4K image before it's sent over cable. This made the tracking faster, more responsive and more accurate.",
    "Invisible and harmless, RedSpy’s LEDs allow the system to blend with any environment. Once installed, RedSpy can start tracking 20 seconds upon power-on and requires no recalibration.",
    "RedSpy emits infrared light which gets reflected back to the camera by reflective markers installed on the ceiling, side walls, or even the floor when used outdoors.",
    "Free movement of in-studio camera pedestals has always been one of the hardest problems to solve when it comes to camera tracking. Today, with a technology like RedSpy, it has become our favourite 'problem' to solve.",
    "RedSpy is the first solution on the market that can send data wirelessly. Additionally, it can be powered by a battery to be completely wire free, which is crucial for reliable steadicam operation."]
